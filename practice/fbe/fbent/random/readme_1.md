Questions:

The first file contains statistics about various dinosaurs. The second file contains additional data.
Given the following formula, speed = ((STRIDE_LENGTH / LEG_LENGTH) - 1) * SQRT(LEG_LENGTH * g)
Where g = 9.8 m/s^2 (gravitational constant)
Write a program to read in the data files from disk, it must then print the names of only the bipedal dinosaurs from fastest to slowest.  

Split array apart into two equal sums.
